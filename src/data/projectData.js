The election voting dApp will accept a single vote from an authorized address and return an immutable vote talley. The vote talley cannot be altered and unauthorized accounts cannot record a vote. \nIn developing this dApp I first wrote a smart contract in Solidity, deployed it to the Kovan testnet, then developed a frontend for the end-user to interact with. The contract does contain code that disallows authorized users to submit more than one vote, but that logic has been commented out in development.",

You can then 'favorite' any NFT which will reorder the entire collection and display the favorited NFTs first. Clicking on any NFT will take you to Solscan.io to display more info about that particular NFT. \nIf a NFT is part of a collection, the title will be edited and the NFT number in the collection will be displayed under the favorite icon. Included is a button to generate a random Solana address.",

    title: "Web3 Random Password Generator",
    description:
      "This app was created using React and was submitted to the Fall 2021 Chainlink Hackathon. It's a simple random password generator but it's randomness is derived from the Chainlink VRF. It calls a smart contract written in Solidity and deployed on the Kovan testnet. By using the Chainlink VRF the randomness of the password can be verified by a blockchain transaction. This verifiable randomness has tremendous application use cases in game logic and anywhere users are affected from a random event.\n The project provided 4 main challenges: 1. create a responsive app with React 2.write and deploy a smart contract with Solidity 3. use Ethers.io and Metamask to communicate between the Ethereum blockchain and the app 4. call the Chainlink VRF and return the result to the app. I was successful in meeting all my initial goals.
